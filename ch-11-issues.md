## adjust introductory paragraph to ch. 11
See #5.

As part of https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1427 it would make sense to adjust the introductory paragraph of chapter 11.
This includes a brief comment about document-focused and text-focused transcription.

## (suggested wording)
This chapter defines a module intended for use in the representation of primary sources as facsimiles and transcription.
The TEI offers two basic approaches for the encoding of such materials, one that views the intellectual units of communication as the 
fundamental hierarchy and one that takes as its primary concern the physical arrangement of text on the inscribed surface.

"document-focused." 
This usage is not meant to imply a rigorous theoretical distinction between "text" and "document," however.
